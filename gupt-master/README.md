An algorithm to hide information over the web.

This alsgorithm is created to use Steganography techniques to hide information over the web pages. It uses the data already available on the web pages and encode the information using these pre existing pages. The encoding is then sent over the web without anyone having a slightest idea about the information and only the decoder with a key can regenerate the whole information.
